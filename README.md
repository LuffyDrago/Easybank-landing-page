## Welcome! üëã

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this static landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.Images file is provided with style guide.

## Motivation üöÄ

I've started learning React and SASS, and I thought this static landing page design is the perfect way to apply what I've learned so far.

## User Stories

The users should be able to:

    * View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
    * See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


## Installation

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

In the project directory, you can run: npm start to run the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Learning Outcomes‚ùó
- The overarching lesson for me in developing the site was project structure.I was unfamiliar with how to access images, and how to setup and use Sass and React.
I chose to create a separate style folder utilizing CSS.

- Creating the Navbar and The header was the hardest part of the project. In creating the Navbar the usestate (React approach) was a learnng experience. I tried using the images as given and failed. I used font-awsome icons to substitute the hamburger and close images on the navbar.
